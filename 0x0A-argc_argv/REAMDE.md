# Learning about command line arguments and how they work
## Learning about argc (stands for argument count) and
## argv (stands for "argument vector")
## Learnt about how to used them within the main function
### The argc returns the number of arguments passed to the program
### The argv[] is an argument vector which is a one dimensional array of sttrings
### So the argv[] is a pointer to the actual strings or argumentso the command line
### This means that argv[] is a pointer to argc
## All is quite fun at ALX, still learning a whole lotta concepts and implementing them appropriately
