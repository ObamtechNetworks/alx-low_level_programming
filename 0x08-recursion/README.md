# Now Learning Recursion
## Recursion is a programming technique
## Recursion involves the breaking down of complex problems
## These complex problems are broken down into smaller subproblems
## After the breakdown, the smaller subproblems are worked upon
## The results from the smaller subproblems are integrated 
## This integration leads us back the main problem, hence:
## The final solution
