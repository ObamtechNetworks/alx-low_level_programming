# Now it's all about function pointers!
## A superpower tool for exploring the possibilities of pointers!
## Function pointers are variables that points to the address of another function
## So, they basically store the address of functions
## Function pointers are pretty useful in handling lots of cases and making codes more smarter!
## Function pointers can be used as callback functions in a regular function!
## More and more lots of fun as a software engineering student at ALX!
