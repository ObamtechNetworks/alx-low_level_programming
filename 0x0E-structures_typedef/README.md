# Here's the my first learning about struct
## structures, short for struct is a user-defined data-type
## struct is used for creating data items of different data types in a single scope
## structures gives us access to group relative properties of objects in a single file
## Wewhich holds the address of an existing or defined structure and then have access to all its elements
## So much fun and more as a software engineering student at ALX!
