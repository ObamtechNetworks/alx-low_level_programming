# Now Learning about Variadic functions in C
## Variadic function are function that allows varying number of arguments
## This means that with functions like this, you can pass in an infinite or indefinite number of arguments to the functions
## The function only needs a single type to be given and then it is followed by an elipsis ... which indicates that there may be more arguments
## Variadic functions examples in the built in C standard library is the fprintf function which allows any kind of valid argument to passed in 
## All is just fun as new concepts and possibilities are being explored as a software Engineering student at ALX
