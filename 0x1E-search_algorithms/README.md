# Search Algorithms
### Project Overview
This project, titled "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms," is part of the curriculum for C programming. The project commenced on March 11, 2024, at 6:00 AM, and must conclude by March 14, 2024, at 6:00 AM. The checker for this project was released on March 12, 2024, at 12:00 AM, with an auto review scheduled for the deadline.

# Resources
To prepare for this project, it is recommended to review the following resources:

- Search algorithm
- Space complexity
- Search Algorithms video playlist

# Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

- Understanding of search algorithms
- Familiarity with linear search
- Knowledge of binary search
- Selection of appropriate search algorithms based on specific requirements

# Requirements
- To ensure compliance with project guidelines, adhere to the following requirements:

- Utilize approved editors: vi, vim, or emacs
- Compilation should be done on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options
- Maintain adherence to the Betty style guide
- Avoid the use of global variables
- Limit functions to a maximum of five per file
- Restrict the use of standard library functions to printf only
- Header files should contain function prototypes and be include guarded
- Document big O notations following the specified format

# Example Formats for Big O Notations
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n\*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))

# Additional Notes
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory for project documentation.
- Ensure that all source code files end with a newline character.
- Avoid including main.c files in your repository, as custom main.c files may be used for compilation during assessment.
- For any clarifications or assistance, refer to project-specific documentation or consult with mentors and peers.
